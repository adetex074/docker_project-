create an instance on AWS "ssh -i "abdul_key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-18-175-47-235.eu-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com"
  ssh the instance to the terminal on the visual studio.
install docker on the ubuntu machine using the following command "for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do sudo apt-get remove $pkg; done"
  install the docker packages, using the following command "sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin"
Then i test if docker is install and working with following commmand "sudo docker run hello-world"
    "Docker is working"
check the docker version using the following command "docker version"
check images in docker "docker images"
check runing images in "docker ps"
i did an extensive check "docker ps -a"
nginx:1.25 pull from docker hub with the following command "docker pull nginx:1.25"
nginx run in background with the following command "docker run -d nginx:1.25"
i then publish the container with a local host, container hosted on "80", local host on "9000", the following command does it "docker run -d -p 9000:80 nginx:1.25
    then i logs the container id for more details "docker logs image id"
    i check the container is actually expose testing it on my browser, by using the security group from my AWS console..binding it to the nginx local host
    then i play around with the following command 
    "docker start image id"
    "docker stop image"
    "docker rm image"
